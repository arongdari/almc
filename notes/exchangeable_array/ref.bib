abstract = {Directed graphs occur throughout statistical modeling of networks, and exchangeability is a natural assumption when the ordering of vertices does not matter. There is a deep structural theory for exchangeable undirected graphs, which extends to the directed case, but with additional complexities that arise from the need to consider the joint distribution over both edge directions on a pair of vertices. Exchangeable directed graphs are characterized by a sampling procedure given by the Aldous-Hoover theorem, which can be described in terms of a distribution on measurable objects known as digraphons. Most existing work on exchangeable graph models has focused on undirected graphs, and little attention has been placed on priors for exchangeable directed graphs. Currently, many directed network models generalize the undirected case by treating each edge direction as independent, rather than considering both edge directions jointly. By placing priors on digraphons one can capture dependence in the edge directions in exchangeable directed graphs, which we demonstrate is not captured by models that consider the edge directions independently. We construct priors on exchangeable directed graphs using digraphons, including special cases such as tournaments, linear orderings, directed acyclic graphs, and partial orderings. We also present a Bayesian nonparametric block model for exchangeable directed graphs and demonstrate inference for these models on synthetic data.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in the analysis of structured relational data like graphs, networks, databases, and matrices is to extract a summary of the common structure underlying relations between individual entities. Relational data are typically encoded in the form of arrays; invariance to the ordering of rows and columns corresponds to exchangeable arrays. Results in probability theory due to Aldous, Hoover and Kallenberg show that exchangeable arrays can be represented in terms of a random measurable function which constitutes the natural model parameter in a Bayesian model. We obtain a flexible yet simple Bayesian nonparametric model by placing a Gaussian process prior on the parameter function. Efficient inference utilises elliptical slice sampling combined with a random sparse approximation to the Gaussian process. We demonstrate applications of the model to network data and clarify its relation to models in the literature, several of which emerge as special cases.},

@article{Settles2010,
abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can achieve greater accuracy with fewer training labels if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.},

@article{Donmez2008,
abstract = {Learning to rank is becoming an increasingly popular research area in machine learning. The ranking problem aims to induce an ordering or preference relations among a set of instances in the input space. However, collecting labeled data is growing into a burden in many rank applications since labeling requires eliciting the relative ordering over the set of alternatives. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning framework for SVM-based and boosting-based rank learning. Our approach suggests sampling based on maximizing the estimated loss differential over unlabeled data. Experimental results on two benchmark corpora show that the proposed model substantially reduces the labeling effort, and achieves superior performance rapidly with as much as 30{\%} relative improvement over the margin-based sampling baseline.
