\section{Exchangeable array}
\begin{definition}[Jointly exchangeable array] A random 2-array $(X_{ij})_{i,j\in \mathbb{N}}$
is jointly exchangeable if
\begin{align}
(X_{ij}) \stackrel{d}{=} (X_{\pi(i)\pi(j)}) \quad \text{for } i,j \in \mathbb{N}^2
\end{align}
for any permutation $\pi$ of $\mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Aldous, Hoover Theorem]\cite{aldous1981representations,hoover1979relations}] A random 2-array $(X_{ij})_{i,j\in \mathbb{N}}$
is jointly exchangeable if and only if there exists a random measurable function $f:[0,1]^3 \rightarrow \mathbf{X}$ such that
\begin{align}
(X_{ij}) \stackrel{d}{=} (f(U_i, U_j, U_{ij})),
\end{align}
where $(U_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $(U_{ij})_{ij>i\in\mathbb{N}}$ with $U_{ij} = U_{ij}$ are a sequence and matrix of i.i.d. Uniform[0,1] random variables.
\end{definition}

For the undirected graph case $\mathcal{X} = \{0,1\}$, the theorem can be simplified further through a random function called \textit{graphon} $W:[0,1]^2 \rightarrow [0,1]$, symmetric in its arguments, where
\[ f(U_i, U_j, U_{ij}) = 
  \begin{cases}
    1       & \quad U_{ij} < W(U_i, U_j)\\
    0  & \quad \mathrm{otherwise}\\
  \end{cases}
\]

\begin{definition}[Sparse Graph]
Let the number of nodes in a graph be $n$. The graph is sparse if the number of edges are $o(n^2)$ or dense if the number of edges are $\Theta(n^2)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}[Graphon is trivially dense]
Every graph represented by graphon $W$ are either empty or dense. The asymptotic proportion of edges is $p = \frac{1}{2}\int W(x, y) dxdy$ and the graph is hence either empty $(p=0)$ or dense (since $O(pn^2) = O(n^2)$).
\end{remark}

In \cite{Lloyd2013}, the authors place a Gaussian process prior over graphon $W:[0,1]^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and transform the output through the logistic function to model the edge probability between nodes.

For the undirected graph case where $X_{ij} = X_{ji}$, one can sample upper triangle of the adjacency matrix, and use the same result for the lower triangle. However, for the directed graph case, by the theorem, both $X_{ij}$ and $X_{ji}$ rely on single parameter $U_{ij}$ which means one should jointly sample ($X_{ij}$, $X_{ji}$) together from three parameters $U_{i}, U_{j}, U_{ij}$. Also, asymmetric graphon $W$ might be employed for directed random graph. However, \cite{Cai2015} show that assymetric graphon is inappropriate to impose certain structures on a graph such as the partial ordering and propose a class of priors for directed graphs.
