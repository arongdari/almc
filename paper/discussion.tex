\section{Discussion}
We have proposed a novel compositional relational model and presented the
Thompson sampling for both compositional and non-compositional models to solve the active knowledge acquisition 
problem. The compositional model aims to infer the latent features of knowledge 
bases by incorporating an additional graph structure. In the passive 
learning scenario, the compositional model outperforms the other models, 
especially, when training size is relatively small. In the active learning 
scenario, however, the compositional model performs worse than the model without 
composition. If the samples of the compositional model follows the posterior 
distribution, it may show the similar performance with the passive learning 
scenario, but this assumption does not always hold since the active sampling
path does not correspond to the passive scenario. One possible explanation is 
that the naive particle Thompson sampling may not capture the posterior of the 
complex compositional structure, so the particle degenerates over time. Recent
 advances in sequential Monte Carlo may help to solve the problem\cite{gu2015neural,naesseth2014sequential,lindsten2014divide}. 
We leave it  for future work.
 
In the active learning scenario, Bayesian RESCAL achieves the highest 
cumulative gain across all datasets. Again, this result emphasise the 
importance of being balanced between exploration and exploitation. One 
important finding of the previous work is that the knowledge population 
and predictive model construction are separate problem, and we need to 
decide which strategy we will use \cite{kajino2015active}. This finding
may hold for some scenarios where their is already a proper amount of 
information to exploit the structure we want to maximise, but the finding 
is not consistence in more conservative cases.

The Thompson sampling has been studied in the context of multi-armed bandit 
problems where the goal is to maximise cumulative gains or minimise cumulative 
regrets over time, whereas its performance on making a predictive model has not 
been widely discussed so far. Its performance on building a generalisable model 
was unclear. Throughout this work, we have empirically shown that maximising 
cumulative gain entails the predictive models as well.

%\section{Discussion}
%There are several limitation of this work. I'll discuss a few of them here, and suggest a new possible direction in a distance space.
%\begin{description}
%\item[Arbitrary output] Normal distribution with the binary output is an arbitrary choice. Why should it be normal? and binary? The problem is more arbitrary when it comes to compositional structure. We place the number of path as the output of compositional normal distribution, but there is no way to say that this approach works with the compositional structure we proposed.
%\item[Arbitrary compositionality] Even we proposed two compositional approaches, the choices of the compositional structures are also arbitrary and not interpretable.

%Let's start from the scratch again. The most easiest way to interpret latent relation $R_k$ is to consider the latent relation as a linear transformation of latent entity $e_i$ to the transformed entity $e_i^\top R_k$, and this linear transformation $e_i^\top R_k$ should be somehow similar to $e_j$ when $(i, k, j)$ is a valid triple. This can be easily formulated in Euclidean distance space. We measure the distance between two entities as $|| e_i^\top R_k - e_j ||_2$ or $|| e_i - e_j^\top R_k^{-1} ||_2$, and let the distances of valid triples be shorter than those of invalid triples. We might want to model this relation in a probabilistic framework, and in this case, the first equation could be modelled as $e_j \sim \mathcal{N}_D(e_i^\top R_k, \Sigma)$ or the second equation as $e_i \sim \mathcal{N}_D(e_j^\top R_k^{-1}, \Sigma)$. The probability distribution of one entity is conditioned on the other entity, and we may model this as a Markov random field with the energy function between two entities as $E(e_i, e_j) = \exp(-||e_i^\top R_k - e_j||_2)$.
%
%Again, this formulation is somewhat weird and seems not well defined. Let's define it in the more general Mahalanobis distance space. In the Mahalanobis space, the distance between two entities $d_{R_k}(e_i, e_j)$ is $\sqrt{(e_i-e_j)^\top R_k (e_i - e_j)}$ (the corresponding probability distribution is a normal distribution with covariance matrix $R_k^{-1}$). 
%Now let's think about the compositional Mahalanobis space. Assume that triples $(i, k1, j)$ and $(j, k2, l)$ is valid triples and $(j, k2, l')$ is an invalid triple. If we define that the compositional Mahalanobis space has precision matrix $R_{k1,k2} = R_{k1} R_{k2}$, is it valid to say $d_{R_{k1,k2}}(i, l)$  of valid compositional path $(i, k1, j) - (j, k2, l)$ is shorter than $d_{R_{k1,k2}}(i, l')$ of invalid compositional path $(i, k1, j)-(j, k2, l')$. So the only thing that we need to prove is if $d_{R_{k1}}(i, j) + d_{R_{k2}}(j, l) < d_{R_{k1}}(i, j) + d_{R_{k2}}(j, l')$ then $d_{R_{k1,k2}}(i, l) < d_{R_{k1,k2}}(i, l')$?
%
%One problem with the distance approach is that the distance metric is symmetric, so we cannot encode the direction of relations. We may define asymmetric Mahalanobis space where the precision matrix $R$ is positive semi-definite but not symmetric.
