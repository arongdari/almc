%Automated processes for knowledge base completion benefit from models that account for
%statistical uncertainty. 
We are concerned with the problem of knowledge base completion, or inferring missing facts from known relations. 
%  It is desirable to take into account paths and compositions, and 
%  able to connect to the knowledge extraction problem by actively 
%  acquiring labeled data points. 
%  Recent knowledge completion algorithms could do either, but not both. 
A human can readily infer a new fact through the composition of known facts in knowledge base,
whereas the current statistical relational models lack the consideration of
active knowledge acquisition through the composition of knowledge.
We propose a probabilistic model to bridge this gap. 
We start from a new formulation of vector space embedding for knowledge tensors  %which generalises the RESCAL model to 
that explicitly model distributions of relations. This
enables us to extend Thompson sampling approach to knowledge bases, and 
%we demonstrate the benefit of active knowledge acquisition. We 
also incorporate additive and multiplicative
approaches for composing relations. 
On synthetic and real world datasets, 
we find that learning with composition is helpful 
when training data is sparse,
and that Thompson sampling provides effective exploitation-exploration strategies 
that balance recall and reconstruction accuracy. 
% and show the regimes where compositional models are
%beneficial for knowledge base completion.

A knowledge base construction consists of a two-step approach; extracting information from external sources, known as knowledge population, and inferring missing information through a statistical analysis on the extracted information, known as knowledge completion.
In many cases, however, there is not enough external sources to extract information. 
An incremental knowledge population via labelling of human experts can help to reduce the gap between two processes. 
In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic knowledge base factorisation method that benefits from the graph path structure of existing knowledge (e.g. syllogism). This explicit probabilistic formulation enable us to develop an incremental population model based on exploitation-exploration strategies.
We demonstrate that the factorisation model with the graph path performs better on the knowledge completion task. Whereas the model without the graph path performs better in the incremental population.
The result leads to a counter-intuitive conclusion; a better predictive model does not guarantee to have a better performance in incremental population.
An additional experiment explains the degeneracy under the model uncertainty.
