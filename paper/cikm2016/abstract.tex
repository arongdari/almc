\begin{abstract}
Knowledge graph construction consists of two tasks: extracting information from external resources  (knowledge population) and inferring missing information through a statistical analysis on the extracted information (knowledge completion). 
In many cases, insufficient external resources in the knowledge population hinder the following statistical inference.
The gap between these two processes can be reduced by an incremental population approach via labelling of human experts.
We propose a new probabilistic knowledge graph factorisation method that benefits from the path structure of existing knowledge (e.g. syllogism) and enables a common modelling approach to be used for both incremental population and knowledge completion tasks.
More specifically, the probabilistic formulation allows us to develop an incremental population algorithm that trades off exploitation-exploration.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the balanced exploitation-exploration helps the incremental population, and the additional path structure helps to predict missing information in the knowledge completion.
