  Automated processes for knowledge base completion benefit from models that account for
  statistical uncertainty. We propose a probabilistic model for low rank tensor factorisation,
  which generalises the RESCAL model to explicitly model distributions of relations. This
  enables us to extend the particle Thompson sampling approach to knowledge bases, and we
  demonstrate the benefit of active knowledge acquisition. We explore additive and multiplicative
  approaches for composing relations, and show the regimes where compositional models are
  beneficial for knowledge base completion.
