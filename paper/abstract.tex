%Automated processes for knowledge base completion benefit from models that account for
%statistical uncertainty. 
We are concerned with the problem of knowledge base completion, or inferring missing facts from known relations. 
%  It is desirable to take into account paths and compositions, and 
%  able to connect to the knowledge extraction problem by actively 
%  acquiring labeled data points. 
%  Recent knowledge completion algorithms could do either, but not both. 
Human can readily infer a new fact through the composition of known facts in knowledge base,
whereas the current statistical relational models lack the consideration of
active knowledge acquisition through the composition of knowledge.
We propose a probabilistic model to bridge this gap. 
We start from a new formulation of vector space embedding for knowledge tensors,  %which generalises the RESCAL model to 
that explicitly model distributions of relations. This
enables us to extend Thompson sampling approach to knowledge bases, and 
%we demonstrate the benefit of active knowledge acquisition. We 
also incorporate additive and multiplicative
approaches for composing relations. 
On synthetic and real world datasets, 
we find that learning with composition is helpful 
when training data is sparse,
and that Thompson sampling provide effective exploit-explore strategies 
that balance recall and reconstruction accuracy. 
% and show the regimes where compositional models are
%beneficial for knowledge base completion.
